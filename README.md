# AnonymizationTool
A simple Anonymization Tool for Japanese texts. (In development)

It uses [Ginza](https://github.com/megagonlabs/ginza) POS tagging to identify potential `Proper Nouns` and replace those with a `[ANON]` tag.

## Execution

It can be executed in two main ways currently:

- Executing `gui.py` will initialize a gui to select files and define the parameters
- To run it in the console, `main.py` can be called, passing the proper parameters.
